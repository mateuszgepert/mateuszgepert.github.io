    Hello my name is Mateusz Gepert. Welcome to my place where I'm gonna explore, drill, question, complain and adore
    all that is related with IT.
</p>
<p>
    Over 12 years on the frontline of the fight for a better code, simpler architecture and robust solutions. I'm JVM
    lover, technology agnoster that looks for simplicity in every aspect of software lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    I live in south of Poland, depends on the year season you might find me either on rocks or climbing gym, so yes
    expect some climbing stuff here as well ;)

<p>Expect some discussion, controversy, frustration, joy but also valuable content</p>
